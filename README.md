# ECS170ConnectFour
Wrote two programs that took into account all the possible configurations to get 4-in-a-row, for a total of 69 possibilities. One program used the MiniMax algorithm while the other used the AlphaBeta algorithm for tree traversal. Compared these configurations to the current game board to score player points. Points for each configuration are out of 4 to reflect how close a player is to a winning configuration. Created an evaluation function based on the number of player 1 and player 2â€™s odd threats, even threats, and number of game pieces on the board. Tested against a stupid AI, a Monte Carlo AI, and against itself. Always wins against stupid AI and Monte Carlo AI, and only sometimes wins against itself.
